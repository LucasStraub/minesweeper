# Minesweeper

Welcome to Minesweeper! This is a simple implementation of the classic Minesweeper game built using the [Unity](https://unity.com/) game engine. 
This project was created as a passion project to explore game development with Unity and hone my game programming skills.
You can play it now on: https://lucasstraub.github.io/minesweeper/

## How to Play

- The game board consists of a grid of cells. Some cells contain mines.
- The player's objective is to uncover all the cells that do not contain mines.
 -If a player uncovers a mine, the game is over.
- Right-clicking on a cell reveals its content: a number indicating how many mines are adjacent to that cell, or a mine itself.
- To win, the player must uncover all non-mine cells without triggering any mines.
- You can also flag potential bombs by left-clicking on a cell.
- Additionally, you may reveal all adjacent cells of a revealed cell, if the number of flags around it equals its number, by clicking on it.
